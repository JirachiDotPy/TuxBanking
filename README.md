# TuxBanking
Tux Banking is a program I wrote in Python that uses hashing and authentication in a bank simulation environment.

The OS module is imported, and the commands used with it in the command line are designed for Linux operating systems.

I wrote this program to put my cybersecurity knowledge into practice by designing a program that performs authentication
through the comparison of hash values (SHA 256) that exist in the database, to those that are inputted by the user.
